# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Refactor the game engine's shader loading system to properly use the ResourceManager for loading and managing shaders instead of direct file loading.

## Key Knowledge
- The project uses a ResourceManager pattern for managing assets like shaders
- Shaders are loaded through `ResourceManager::LoadShader()` which handles file path resolution
- The incorrect pattern was using `LoadShaderFromFile` directly with hardcoded relative paths like `"shaders/core.vs"` and `"shaders/core.fs"`
- Correct usage involves calling ResourceManager methods that automatically resolve full paths using functions like `GetShaderPath()`
- The ResourceManager header is located at `src/asset/ResourceManager.h`

## Recent Actions
- Identified incorrect shader loading pattern in the codebase
- Located and analyzed the ResourceManager implementation
- Found that shaders should be loaded using `ResourceManager::LoadShader()` method
- Discovered the correct signature takes shader file names and resolves paths internally

## Current Plan
1. [TODO] Update shader loading code to use `ResourceManager::LoadShader()` instead of direct file loading
2. [TODO] Remove hardcoded relative paths and use shader file names only
3. [TODO] Ensure all shader loading calls go through the ResourceManager for proper path resolution
4. [TODO] Test the refactored shader loading system to verify correct functionality
